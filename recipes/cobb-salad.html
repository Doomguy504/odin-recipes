        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p style="width: 50rem;">
            A Cobb salad is an American dish that consists of lettuce topped with bacon, chicken, boiled eggs, 
            tomatoes, and other ingredients arranged in neat rows. It is traditionally served as a main course. 
            The origins of the classic salad is unclear, but many believe it was created in the late 1930s at 
            the Brown Derby restaurant in Hollywood.
